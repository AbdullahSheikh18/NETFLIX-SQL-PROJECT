This project simulates a **Netflix-like database** using SQL. It contains the structure and queries necessary to track user activity, including movies watched, user ratings, and movie details.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to set up and manage a **Netflix-like database** using SQL. It includes:
- **Users** who subscribe to different plans (e.g., Premium, Standard).
- **Movies** with different genres and ratings.
- **Watch history** to track which movies each user has watched.
- **Ratings** to record how each user rates the movies they watch.

The goal is to simulate a small-scale Netflix database and provide useful queries to analyze user activity and movie popularity.
